Our program did not work as intended. The ouput shows that all of the objects in our 
array copy are FlyionObject objects, instead of what we actually set them in the driver.

This is because polymorphism did not kick in, since there is no overriding being done.
Due to polymorphism not working, instead of the constructor for each different object 
being called, only the constructor for FlyingObjects is being called.
